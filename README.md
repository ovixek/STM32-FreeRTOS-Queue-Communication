# STM32 FreeRTOS Queue Communication Demo

This project demonstrates multitasking and inter-task communication
using FreeRTOS queues on an STM32 microcontroller.

## Features
- Multiple FreeRTOS tasks
- Producer–Processor–Consumer model
- Queue-based data sharing
- LED indication using GPIO
- UART logging for debugging

## Hardware Used
- STM32F4 Discovery
- Onboard LEDs (PD12–PD15)
- UART2 @ 115200 baud

## Software Tools
- STM32CubeIDE
- FreeRTOS
- Embedded C

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand task scheduling, queue synchronization,
and real-time embedded system design.
